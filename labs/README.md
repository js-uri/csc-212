# Labs

Labs are designed to provide hands-on experience to students in applying the concepts and theories taught in lectures. The purpose of labs is to allow students to gain practical skills and experience in programming and development with data structures and algorithms.

Labs often involve a series of tests that require students to write code, solve problems, and work with software tools and technologies. Through these exercises, students learn how to apply the theoretical concepts they have learned in lectures to real-world problems and situations.

Additionally, labs can provide an opportunity for students to work collaboratively with their peers and receive feedback from their instructors. This collaborative approach can help to reinforce key concepts and facilitate a deeper understanding of the material.

## Common errors

Segmentation fault
- This occurs when a program tries to access a memory location that it is not allowed to access. This can happen when accessing invalid pointers or arrays.
Array out of bounds
- This error occurs when you try to access an array element outside the bounds of the array. This can lead to unpredictable behavior or crashes.
Null pointer dereference
- This occurs when you try to dereference a null pointer. This can happen when you forget to initialize a pointer or when you free a pointer and then try to access it.
Memory leaks
- This happens when you allocate memory dynamically and then forget to free it. This can lead to your program using up all available memory and crashing.
Use after free: This occurs when you free a pointer and then try to access it again. This can lead to unpredictable behavior or crashes.
Double free
- This occurs when you free a pointer more than once. This can lead to memory corruption and crashes.
Uninitialized variable
- This occurs when you use a variable without initializing it first. This can lead to unpredictable behavior.
Type mismatch
- This occurs when you try to assign a value of one type to a variable of a different type. This can lead to compiler errors or unpredictable behavior.
Incorrect use of operators
- This occurs when you use operators incorrectly, such as using the assignment operator instead of the equality operator.
Incorrect function arguments
- This occurs when you pass incorrect arguments to a function. This can lead to compiler errors or unpredictable behavior.
Incorrect return type
- This occurs when you declare a function with one return type but then return a value of a different type. This can lead to compiler errors or unpredictable behavior.
Incorrect use of loops
- This occurs when you use loops incorrectly, such as using an infinite loop or using the wrong loop control variable.
Incorrect use of pointers
- This occurs when you use pointers incorrectly, such as dereferencing a null pointer or using a dangling pointer.
Incorrect use of references
- This occurs when you use references incorrectly, such as passing a reference to a temporary object or modifying a const reference.
Incorrect use of templates
- This occurs when you use templates incorrectly, such as not specifying template arguments or using non-template functions with template arguments.
Incorrect use of namespaces
- This occurs when you use namespaces incorrectly, such as not qualifying function or class names properly.
Incorrect use of constructors or destructors
- This occurs when you use constructors or destructors incorrectly, such as not properly initializing member variables or not freeing memory in the destructor.
Incorrect use of inheritance
- This occurs when you use inheritance incorrectly, such as not properly calling base class constructors or not using virtual functions when needed.
Incorrect use of overloaded operators
- This occurs when you overload operators incorrectly, such as not returning the correct type or not properly handling references.
Incorrect use of STL containers
- This occurs when you use STL containers incorrectly, such as not properly initializing them or accessing them incorrectly.

It is important to note that these are not the only possible errors when working with data structures in C++. It is always important to thoroughly test your code and ensure that it is working as intended.
