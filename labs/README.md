# Labs

Labs are designed to provide hands-on experience to students in applying the concepts and theories taught in lectures. The purpose of labs is to allow students to gain practical skills and experience in programming and development with data structures and algorithms.

Labs often involve a series of tests that require students to write code, solve problems, and work with software tools and technologies. Through these exercises, students learn how to apply the theoretical concepts they have learned in lectures to real-world problems and situations.

Additionally, labs can provide an opportunity for students to work collaboratively with their peers and receive feedback from their instructors. This collaborative approach can help to reinforce key concepts and facilitate a deeper understanding of the material.
